            <p>Iâ€™m a Front-End Developer with a background as a fine artist. I love simplifying processes and improving workflows, with experience in both email integration and web development, I had the opportunity to guide teammates while leading the transition from Dreamweaver to MJML, making development more efficient and modern. I stay curious, keep up with best practices, and enjoy exploring new tools and techniques to learn.</p>
